# CS5610-FinalProject
Final project for CS5610 using OpenGL. This project is simulating the "non-Euclidean" natures found in games such as *Portal*, *Stanley's Parable*, and *Antichamber.* This project is concerned with geometry-based non-Euclidean geometry rather than density. This was a four week project so density based non-Euclidean was out of scope of the assignment. This project also has VR enabled.

The non-Euclidean nature takes place both in the vertex shader or geometry shader. This also experiments with non-Euclidean shapes by generating their nature during tessellation then using the geometry shader to manipulate the vertices.
