# CS5610-FinalProject
Final project for CS5610 using OpenGL. This project is simulating the "non-Euclidean" natures found in games such as *Portal*, *Stanley's Parable*, and *Antichamber.* This project is concerned with geometry-based non-Euclidean geometry rather than density. This was a four week project so density based non-Euclidean was out of scope of the assignment. This project also has VR enabled.

The non-Euclidean nature takes place both in the vertex shader or geometry shader. This also experiments with non-Euclidean shapes by generating their nature during tessellation then using the geometry shader to manipulate the vertices.

## Project Description
The final project for Spring 2019 CS 5610 Interactive Computer Graphics is a 4 week long project to implement something related to the class. It can be anything like rendering water, global illumination, or raytracing if the invididual's graphics card supports it. However, for my project, I decided to implement a non-Euclidean rendering engine using OpenGL. This was inspired by [this video, Non-Euclidean Worlds Engine by Code Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8) as I am curious to see how it could be used in other facets for interactive graphics.

This project was extended to my undergraduate thesis project and will be brought to [Project Aether](https://github.com/MichaelGardone/ProjectAether).
