# CS5610-FinalProject
Final project for CS5610 using Vulkan rather than OpenGL.

## Project Description
The final project for Spring 2019 CS 5610 Interactive Computer Graphics is a 4 week long project to implement something related to the class. It can be anything like rendering water, global illumination, or raytracing if the invididual's graphics card supports it. However, for my project, I decided to implement a non-Euclidean rendering engine using Vulkan. This was inspired by [this video, Non-Euclidean Worlds Engine by Code Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8) as I am curious to see how it could be used in other facets for interactive graphics.

This project was extended to my undergraduate thesis project and will be brought to [Project Aether](https://github.com/MichaelGardone/ProjectAether).
